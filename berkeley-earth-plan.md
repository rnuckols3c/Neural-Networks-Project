# Neural Network Modeling Plan for Berkeley Earth Temperature Dataset

## 1. Strategic Approach

Based on the EDA findings, implementing 2-3 different neural network architectures to explore different aspects of the temperature data will allow:
- Demonstration of which architectures are appropriate for different types of climate data patterns
- Comparison of performance across models
- Extraction of meaningful insights about the dataset's predictive potential

## 2. Model Selection and Justification

Recommended neural network architectures:

### A. Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)
- **Justification**: The EDA identified clear temporal patterns (warming trends, seasonal decomposition). TCNs excel at capturing long-range dependencies in time series while being computationally efficient.
- **Task**: Predict future temperature trends based on historical patterns.

### B. LSTM/GRU Network
- **Justification**: The EDA showed different climate regimes and potential early warning signals for shifts. LSTM/GRU networks are designed to detect patterns across varying time scales.
- **Task**: Identify regime shifts or extreme event precursors in temperature records.

### C. Convolutional LSTM (Optional Third Model)
- **Justification**: The EDA revealed spatial temperature patterns (urban heat islands, latitudinal gradients). Conv-LSTM combines spatial and temporal feature extraction.
- **Task**: Model urban heat island effects or spatial temperature propagation.

## 3. Implementation Plan

### Data Preparation
1. **Temporal Data Preparation**:
   - Create sliding window sequences from time series
   - Address measurement uncertainty (incorporate as weights or confidence intervals)
   - Split into training/validation/test sets with attention to temporal ordering
   - Normalize features appropriately

2. **Spatial-Temporal Data Preparation**:
   - Create gridded temperature datasets
   - Generate lat/long feature matrices
   - Handle varying data quality across time periods
   - Create masking for missing data points

### Model Development
1. **TCN Implementation**:
   - Build architecture with appropriate dilation factors for long-term dependencies
   - Test different kernel sizes to capture seasonal patterns
   - Implement residual connections for gradient stability
   - Use dropout for regularization

2. **LSTM/GRU Implementation**:
   - Structure with bidirectional layers to capture forward/backward dependencies
   - Test different sequence lengths to identify optimal temporal context
   - Implement attention mechanism to focus on potential regime shift indicators
   - Add regularization layers to handle limited data for extreme events

3. **Conv-LSTM Implementation (Optional)**:
   - Design spatial convolutional filters appropriate for geographic data
   - Implement appropriate pooling strategy for spatial downsampling
   - Set up architecture to capture both local and global patterns
   - Add regularization to handle sparse spatial data

### Training and Evaluation
1. **Training Strategy**:
   - Implement early stopping based on validation performance
   - Test different optimizers (Adam, RMSprop)
   - Experiment with learning rate schedules
   - Log training metrics for later analysis

2. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - For regression tasks: MSE, MAE, RÂ²
   - For classification/anomaly detection: precision, recall, F1-score
   - Domain-specific metrics: Fraction of variance explained, weather signal detection rates
   - Compute uncertainty estimates for predictions

3. **Baseline Comparisons**:
   - Implement statistical baselines (ARIMA, exponential smoothing)
   - Simple machine learning models (Random Forest, SVR)
   - Compare neural network performance against these baselines

### Analysis and Presentation Preparation
1. **Results Analysis**:
   - Visualize model predictions against actual data
   - Analyze model performance across different regions and time periods
   - Identify where models succeed and fail
   - Extract learned features from networks

2. **Interpretation**:
   - Connect model findings to physical climate phenomena
   - Analyze what each architecture learned about the data
   - Compare with expert knowledge from climate science

3. **Final Presentation Preparation**:
   - Create visualizations of model performance
   - Prepare code demos/notebooks
   - Draft slides on methodology, results, and interpretation

## 4. Specific Research Questions to Address

Based on the EDA, these are specific questions the models should address:

1. **Temporal Pattern Detection**:
   - Can neural networks detect the acceleration in warming trends post-1980 that was identified in the EDA?
   - How accurately can models predict temperature anomalies at monthly, seasonal, and annual scales?

2. **Regime Identification**:
   - Can models learn to distinguish between the two climate regimes (tropical/temperate) identified?
   - Can neural networks detect shifts in climate regime boundaries over time?

3. **Urban Heat Island Analysis**:
   - Can models quantify and predict urban-rural temperature differentials?
   - What features contribute most to urban heat island intensity?

4. **Extreme Event Precursors**:
   - Can neural networks identify precursor patterns to temperature extremes?
   - How do models perform when tasked with early warning signal detection?
